## About Page

### Page Headline
**Built by Service Pros, for Service Pros**

### Our Story

Kinvo started in a garage in Phoenix.

Our founder was running a small HVAC repair business, spending Sunday nights handwriting invoices and waiting months to get paid. Sound familiar?

He tried the "business software" designed by people in suits who had never turned a wrench or cleaned a house. It was overcomplicated, expensive, and built for Fortune 500 companies, not working people.

So he built Kinvo - invoice software for people who actually work for a living.

### Why We're Different

**We get it.** We've been there.

We know what it's like to:
- Wait 2 months for a customer to pay a $300 invoice
- Lose a job because your handwritten estimate looked unprofessional
- Spend weekends doing paperwork instead of being with family
- Feel embarrassed about your "system" when customers ask for receipts

Kinvo wasn't built in a Silicon Valley office by people who've never done real work. It was built by service professionals who needed better tools to run their businesses.

### Our Promise

**Simple tools for hard-working people.**

We believe every service professional deserves to:
- Get paid quickly and professionally
- Look as good as their work
- Spend time working, not doing paperwork
- Build a business they're proud of

That's why Kinvo is:
- **Simple** - No MBA required to figure it out
- **Honest** - No hidden fees or pushy sales tactics  
- **Reliable** - Works when you need it to work
- **Affordable** - Pays for itself in the first week

### The Team

We're a small team of developers, designers, and business people who respect the work you do. Some of us still run service businesses on the side. We use Kinvo ourselves.

When you email support, you're talking to someone who understands your business.

[First Name],

Yesterday you joined Kinvo. Today, let's create your first professional invoice.

Here's what Frank (handyman in Dallas) told us after his first invoice:
*"Holy crap, I look legit now. Customer paid me in 2 days instead of 2 weeks."*

Need help? Just reply to this email.

**Email 3: Case Study - Frank's Story (Day 4)**
Subject: How Frank went from 45 days to 3 days

[First Name],

Let me tell you about Frank Harris.

Frank's a handyman in Dallas. Great work, fair prices, customers love him. But he had one problem - customers took forever to pay.

His handwritten invoices looked... well, like homework. Customers would "lose" them, forget about them, or just ignore them.

Frank was doing $8,000/month in work but only collecting $3,000 because he was always waiting to get paid.

Here's what changed when Frank started using Kinvo:
✅ Professional invoices that customers take seriously
✅ Automatic payment reminders (no awkward conversations)
✅ Online payments (no more "check's in the mail")
✅ Mobile invoicing from his truck

Result: Average payment time dropped from 45 days to 3 days.

That's an extra $5,000/month in Frank's pocket. Same work, same customers, just professional invoices.

**Email 4: Common Mistakes (Day 7)**
Subject: 3 mistakes that slow down your payments

[First Name],

I've helped 2,847+ service professionals get paid faster. Here are the 3 biggest mistakes I see:

**Mistake #1: Waiting to invoice**
Fast-paying customers: Get invoiced same day
Slow-paying customers: Get invoiced "when I get around to it"

**Mistake #2: Unclear line items**
Fast-paying customers: See exactly what they're paying for
Slow-paying customers: Get confused by vague descriptions

**Mistake #3: Making it hard to pay**
Fast-paying customers: Can pay online in 30 seconds
Slow-paying customers: Have to mail checks or remember to call

Kinvo fixes all three automatically.

### Objection-Handling Emails

**"I'm not tech-savvy"**
Subject: You don't need to be tech-savvy to use Kinvo

[First Name],

I got your reply about not being "tech-savvy."

Let me put your mind at ease. Kinvo is designed for people who fix things, not computer things.

Here's how simple it is:
1. Type what you did
2. Type what it costs  
3. Hit send

That's it. If you can send a text message, you can use Kinvo.

Plus, I'm here to help. Need a hand getting set up? Just reply and I'll walk you through it personally.

**"My customers won't pay online"**
Subject: "My customers don't pay online" (this might surprise you)

[First Name],

I hear this concern a lot: "My customers are old-school. They won't pay online."

Here's what actually happens when you give customers the OPTION to pay online:

- 73% choose to pay online (it's easier)
- Average payment time drops from 28 days to 5 days  
- You still get checks from customers who prefer that

The key word is OPTION. You're not forcing anything, just making it easier for customers who want to pay quickly.

And those customers who pay quickly? They become your favorite customers real fast.

Want to see which of your customers prefer to pay fast?
[Try Kinvo Free Button]

**"It costs too much"**
Subject: Does Kinvo really cost too much?

[First Name],

I understand - $29/month feels like a lot when you're watching every penny.

Let me break down the real cost:

**Without Kinvo:**
- Average payment time: 35 days
- Awkward payment conversations: Priceless (and not in a good way)
- Time spent on invoicing: 3 hours/week
- Lost jobs due to unprofessional estimates: 2/month

**With Kinvo ($29/month):**
- Average payment time: 6 days  
- Awkward conversations: Zero
- Time spent invoicing: 20 minutes/week
- Professional estimates that win more jobs

If Kinvo helps you get paid just ONE $500 invoice 20 days faster, it pays for itself for 17 months.

Most customers see that return in the first week.
